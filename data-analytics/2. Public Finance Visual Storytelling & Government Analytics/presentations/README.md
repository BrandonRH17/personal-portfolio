## 📊 Report Format

**File Details:**
- PDF format for universal accessibility
- Designed for government stakeholders
- Comprehensive written analysis
- Embedded visualizations from Power BI dashboard
- Evidence-based fraud documentation

**Audience Considerations:**

Given the **non-technical government audience** (Guatemala Ministry officials, IMF fiscal policy experts, public health administrators), the report emphasizes:

1. **High-Level Diagrams:**
   - Conceptual data flow (not technical architecture)
   - Business process visualization
   - Stakeholder-friendly graphics
   - Focus on "what" rather than "how"

2. **Visual Storytelling:**
   - Dashboard screenshots with annotations
   - Before/after comparisons
   - Pattern highlighting
   - Executive-friendly charts

3. **Narrative Structure:**
   - Problem → Investigation → Evidence → Impact
   - Clear section headings
   - Bullet-point summaries
   - Actionable recommendations

**Why High-Level Diagrams?**

Technical implementation details were intentionally **omitted from the main presentation** because:
- ✅ Government officials needed to understand **business value**, not technical architecture
- ✅ IMF jury focused on **policy impact** and **replicability**
- ✅ Detailed data models were provided separately to technical government staff
- ✅ Storytelling award criteria valued **communication clarity** over technical complexity

**Technical Documentation Delivered Separately:**
- Detailed data models (Entity-Relationship Diagrams)
- SQL queries and transformation logic
- Power BI DAX measures documentation
- Implementation specifications for IT teams
