## Project Summaries

### 1. GDELT Big Data Analytics — Maritime Port Disruption Prediction
**Award: Overall Grand Winner — Factored Datathon 2024**

Processed massive volumes of GDELT global news data on Databricks to predict maritime port disruptions before they occur. Built a medallion architecture pipeline (Bronze → Silver → Gold) using Spark SQL, and delivered a near real-time Power BI dashboard for maritime operators with 2–7 day disruption forecasting.

**Stack:** Databricks, Spark SQL, Python, Power BI, Medallion Architecture
**Highlights:** Geospatial event filtering, Goldstein Scale sentiment analysis, risk scoring system

### 2. Public Finance Visual Storytelling & Government Analytics
**Award: Best Storytelling and Financial Analytics — IMF ChallengeGT 2022**

Analyzed Guatemala government procurement data from 4 integrated systems to detect COVID-era fraud patterns: price inflation and purchase splitting below the GTQ 50,000 reporting threshold. Delivered a Power BI dashboard and visual narrative for IMF and government officials under a live competition format.

**Stack:** Power BI, Guatecompras, SICOIN, SIGES, RGAE
**Highlights:** Z-score anomaly detection, threshold-evasion pattern recognition, executive storytelling

### 3. MIMIC Healthcare Analytics
Analysis of real deidentified clinical data (MIMIC-IV Demo, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) covering 100 patients, 275 admissions, and 140 ICU stays. Three EDA notebooks explore patient demographics, ICD diagnosis patterns, and ICU outcomes — culminating in an executive report for ICU patient prioritization and resource allocation.

**Stack:** Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter
**Highlights:** Age-based mortality stratification, high-risk diagnosis identification, clinical decision framework

### 4. Analytics Engineering with Marketing Data
End-to-end dbt pipeline over DuckDB that takes synthetic marketing data (50K customers, 200 campaigns, 300K clicks) through a clean staging → mart architecture. Implements reusable macros for data standardization, 20+ automated quality tests, and produces a validated campaign performance mart — all with zero cloud infrastructure required.

**Stack:** dbt-core, DuckDB, Python, Faker, Jupyter
**Highlights:** Staging/mart separation, custom macros, singular and generic test suite, fully reproducible in under 2 minutes
