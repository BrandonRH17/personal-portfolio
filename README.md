## About Me

This is my space where I share projects, knowledge, and experiences in key areas of technology and data. My goal is to demonstrate how the intersection of data, engineering, artificial intelligence, and product management can create innovative and high-impact solutions.

## 🚀 Areas of Expertise

### 📊 Data Analytics
Transforming data into actionable insights through rigorous analysis and clear communication. Projects span healthcare, public finance, and geopolitics — always ending in something a decision-maker can act on:
- Exploratory data analysis with Python and statistical methods
- Power BI dashboards and executive visual storytelling
- Healthcare data standards (ICD-9/ICD-10) and clinical analytics
- Fraud detection and anomaly identification in government data

### ⚙️ Data Engineering
Building reliable, structured pipelines from raw ingestion to analytics-ready tables:
- Cloud-scale big data processing with Databricks and Apache Spark
- Medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) on Delta Lake
- ELT transformation pipelines with dbt and layered data modeling
- Data quality testing, source declarations, and pipeline lineage

### 🤖 Agentic AI
Building AI agents that solve real business problems — from lead qualification to personalized content generation:
- AI agent architecture with OpenAPI tool-use and serverless orchestration
- Vector search integration for semantic retrieval across business entities
- Automated CRM management, quote generation, and personalized video creation
- End-to-end agent products built for hackathons and real-world deployment

### 📱 Product Management
Leading software and AI-powered products from roadmap to production, with cross-functional teams and measurable business outcomes:
- Data product strategy, roadmapping, and prioritization
- Offshore engineering team leadership (8+ engineers across time zones)
- Platform migration planning and vendor dependency removal
- Self-service analytics tooling and stakeholder alignment
- AI agent design and low-code product development (Retool, n8n)
- Multi-product delivery across internal and external audiences
