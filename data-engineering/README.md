# ⚙️ Data Engineering

This section showcases my data engineering projects and expertise. Here, I demonstrate end-to-end data pipeline workflows covering:

## Key Areas

- **ETL/ELT Pipeline Development**: Building scalable data ingestion and transformation pipelines
- **Medallion Architecture**: Implementing Bronze → Silver → Gold data lakehouse patterns
- **Big Data Technologies**: Working with Apache Spark, Delta Lake, and Databricks
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Automating complex data workflows with dependency management
- **Data Quality & Governance**: Enforcing schema validation, data quality checks, and access controls
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Deploying pipelines on AWS S3, Databricks, and Unity Catalog

## Projects

Each project demonstrates practical application of modern data engineering techniques, from raw data ingestion to analytics-ready tables ready for business intelligence and machine learning.
